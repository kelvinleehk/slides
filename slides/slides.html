    <p>Jibberish on various (x100) tools that I have found extremely useful over the years</p>

    <h1>A Developer's (Secret) Toolbox</h1>

    <h2>Secret sauce to success</h2>
</div>
<hr/>

<div>
    <h1>What</h1>

    <h2>makes a successful developer?</h2>
</div>
<hr/>

<h1>Knowledge?</h1>
<h2>Number of languages she knows?</h2>
<hr/>

<h1>Speed?</h1>
<h2>How fast she could code an app / website?</h2>
<hr/>

<h1>Personally</h1>
<h2>I think...</h2>
<hr/>

<h1>Good developer</h1>
<h2>should be able to write <em>fast</em> code and have <em>broad knowledge</em> in various popular <em>languages</em>
    and <em>technologies</em></h2>
<hr/>

<h1>Great developer</h1>
<h2>will write <em>clean</em>, <em>decoupled</em> and <em>recyclable</em> code in a concise manner.</h2>
<hr/>

<em><h2>And that is the origin of <em>all things that's good</em> in the world of coding</h2></em>
<hr/>

<h1>How </h1>
<h2>do we do that?</h2>
<hr/>

<h1>2 x Tools</h1>
<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Write testable code</li>
    <li>Gitflow</li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<h1>What is Testable Code?</h1>
<p>
    In short: <br/><em>Testable</em> is you code are organized in a way that can be easily tested through unit testing.
</p>
<hr/>

<h1>What Testable Code's NOT?</h1>
<p>Code that you need to test. (Yeah you've heard right)</p>

<hr/>
<h1>To be precise</h1>
<p>Testable code is more a <em>design pattern</em> than a standard / requirement that keeps your code <em>clean</em>,
    <em>decoupled</em>, <em>recyclable</em> and
    <em>structured</em> in a concise manner.</p>
<br/>
<p>It's the core of Test Driven Development (TDD)</p>
<hr/>

<h1>How to make code testable?</h1>
<hr/>

<h1>How to make code testable?</h1>
<p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Separation of concerns</em></li>
    <li>Object-oriented code design</li>
    <li><em>Loose coupling / dependency injection</em></li>
    <li><em>Elimination of globals</em></li>
    <li>API naming conventions</li>
    <li>Clear code and documentation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr/>

<h1>Separation of concerns</h1>
<p>
    Grand example:
    <br/>
    <em>Model-View-Controller</em> (MVC)
</p>
<hr/>

<h1>Separation of concerns</h1>
<p>Imagine when you have some of your Balance Sheet function logic and calcuation somewhere inside of your view that
    shows the report, and that you had to make some changes to the net profit calcuation in your controller logic.
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <em>the result will always be wrong</em>!</p>
<hr/>

<h1>Separation of concerns</h1>
<p>Not only separating the concerns will help keep code highly maintainable (you know exactly where to look instead of
    doing a full codebase search), it will greatly help reduce code regression, thus more efficient coding workflow.
</p>
<hr/>

<h1>Separation of concerns</h1>
<h2> Don't try to have your functions to do too many things at the same time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h1>Loose coupling</h1>
<h2>/ Dependency Injection</h2>
<p>while performing unit testing, functions will be run and tested individually instead of having the whole boostrap
    process of your site or application to run.</p>
<p>Which means by the time the function is being tested, not all the expected dependency will be made available.</p>
<hr/>

<h1>Loose coupling</h1>
<p>Take a look at this example</p>
<p><img src="images/example2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<hr/>

<h1>Loose coupling</h1>
<p>A better example</p>
<p><img src="images/example3.jpg" alt=""/>&nbsp;<img src="images/example4.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<hr/>

<h1>Elimination of Global Variables</h1>
<p>There are more than often, even for the most advance framework, will use certain Gllobal Variables to help passing information from one part of the code to another.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>Elimination of Global Variables</h1>
<p>While it is very, very very convenient to use Global Variables, it always comes with a great risks that the gloabl variable will get contaminated somewhere in your code.</p>
<hr/>

<h1>Elimination of Global Variables</h1>
<p>Should be hard to see why:</p>
<p><img src="images/example5.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<hr/>

<h1>Gitflow</h1>
<h2>Good coder comes great responsibility</h2>
